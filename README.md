Hey there, I’m Andero from Estonia! 🇪🇪👨‍💻  
I’m a curious coder constantly tinkering with new projects, from building web apps to experimenting with JavaScript and React. 🌐🔧  
Right now, I’m diving into front-end development. 📚  
I’m always open to collaborating on projects that are both fun and a little out of the ordinary—think interactive web apps or anything that pushes creative boundaries. 🤝  
Pronouns: He/Him (just in case you were wondering!) 👀
